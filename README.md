# Daily Photo Dump

A beautifully minimal daily photo journal that captures one moment, every day.

## Concept

Daily Photo Dump is a calming, low-pressure visual diary. You get one photo per day — automatically selected — to capture your day without overthinking. Whether it's a quiet street corner or a silly pet moment, this is your space to let the day go.

This product is powered by an AI platform that will build the functional app — this repo is focused on product experience, design, and concept definition.

## Core Experience

The main interface is a daily landing page that reflects your life in real time. No social pressure, no likes, just you and your days.

### Landing Page

- Today's Date & Time  
  Subtly styled at the top of the page, always current.

- Countdown Timer  
  A live countdown showing how much time is left today — adding a sense of now.

- Add Today's Photo Button  
  The centerpiece action. Triggers photo selection and upload flow.

- Photo List with Timestamp  
  Once uploaded, your daily photo is displayed in a chronological list, with timestamp and optional caption.

## Photo Upload Flow

The act of uploading is ritualized and limited:

- Auto-Selected Photo  
  When you tap "Add Today's Photo", the system smartly selects one image from your device’s photo library for today.

- Veto Option  
  You get one chance to veto. If you veto, the system selects another — no going back.

- Fallback Selection  
  If no photo is available from today, the system randomly selects from this week’s photo library (Monday–Sunday).

- Caption Input  
  Optional — add a short note (max 120 characters). A small, poetic window to express your day.

- Final Upload Button  
  Once confirmed, the photo is saved as your one official photo of the day.

## Philosophy

- Simplicity over perfection  
  No pressure to curate. No multiple takes. Just one.

- Mindfulness over metrics  
  No likes. No shares. Just presence and reflection.

- Personal design  
  This is a private, aesthetic, and emotionally calm product — minimal UI, soft colors, generous whitespace.

## Tech Note

This README focuses on idea, design, and UX. Technical implementation will be auto-generated via an AI-powered development platform capable of building fully functional apps from product specs.

## Why It Matters

In a world of infinite scrolling and over-documentation, Daily Photo Dump invites you to look once, choose once, and move on — a daily pause, one image at a time.
